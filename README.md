# Econ-215
This Shiny application is created to allow my introductory stat class students to estimate their final grades. Some students often ask me what should they do to get a certain grade. This app allows them to answer their own question.
By default, the app assumes certain grades. Please change the grades as you wish, or in accordance with your current grades.
Run the following code in your RStudio Console to start the app:
shiny::runGitHub('Econ-215', 'Salfo')
